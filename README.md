Weather Dashboard


## What is this weather Dashboard for?
* AS A traveler I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

# Why?
* I built this weatherdash board as a homework assignment to apply a Server Side- API

# How?
* I am using a weather API from https://openweathermap.org/current to pull data from the server that will show a searched cities current wether. I also used Bootstrap for some CSS styling.

I present the user with the follwing weather info:
- City Name
- Current Date
- Temperture (celcius)
- Wind Speed
- Humidity

* A User  uses the search Input to type in a city to view the cities current weather.

# Future applications to add?
- Connect the Pre selected city buttons to there API information

- Connect the follwing 4 day weather forcast cards i created.

- Complete the CSS plans
